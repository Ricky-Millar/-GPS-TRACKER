# -GPS-TRACKER
A gps based tracket, comunicating through MAVLINK to tell me where to aim my antennas for maximum range.


Just getting started with this, Struggling to work out a few bugs connecting my rado transmitter to my pc. but once that is sorted, this is a pc part of the aplication where gps 
coordinates are pulled from the drone and proscesed to give angles that tell the pilot where to aim their antennas.

The end-goal is to have a device that connect to FPV goggles to indicate to the pilot if they have a good head position in terms of antenna orientation. 

later I hope to upload 3d files and pcb designs and complete this project, but I am wating on new firmware for my transmitter which should fix some bugs I am having with connecting over TCP for MAVlink
